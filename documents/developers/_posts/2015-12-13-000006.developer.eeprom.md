#### **EEPROM**

   * The CAT24C256 is a 256 kb Serial CMOS EEPROM, internally organized as 32,768 words of 8 bits each.
   It features a 64−byte page write buffer and supports the Standard (100 kHz), Fast (400 kHz) and Fast−Plus (1 MHz) I2C protocol.
   Write operations can be inhibited by taking the WP pin High (this protects the entire memory).
   External address pins make it possible to address up to eight  CAT24C256 devices on the same bus.
   On−Chip ECC (Error Correction Code) makes the device suitable for high reliability applications. rtc.

##### **Driver**


   * If you haven't already done that, download BH drivers and demo code like this:

    git clone https://github.com/bithollow/BH
    cd BH/driver

   * Move to folder BH/driver/, you will find the eeprom driver: eeprom.h eeprom.cpp


##### **Demo**

   * eeprom example

  Move to folder BH/demo/eeprom, compile and run the example

    cd BH/demo/eeprom
    make
    ./eeprom -h

  the usage will display while executing above command.
