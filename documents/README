How to add a post
-----------------

The original directory layout looks like the following:

documents/
|-- developers
|   `-- _posts
`-- users
    `-- _posts

- Document posts should be .md files under _posts.

- Naming of each post should be
  yyyy-mm-dd-$(POST_NUM)-$(POST_NAME).md

  $(POST_NUM) is the sequence number of total posts count, use 6 digits for
  alignment purpose. The number couldn't be the same as any of the exists post
  in the same directory

  $(POST_NAME) could be any string, for each word in the string, use dot to
  separate. It is the default post name that will be displayed. One can also use
  a different post name from the file name by specifying the YAML front matter
  inside the .md file.

  For instance,
  2015-04-01-000000-today.is.a.good.day.to.die.md
  2015-04-01-000001-loud.and.clear.md

- YAML front matter in each post
  ---
  title: $(POST_TITLE)
  section: $(POST_SECTION_NUM)
  section_title: $(SECTION_TITLE)
  ---

  $(POST_TITLE) is the post title will be displayed. It overrides the
  $(POST_NAME) in file name if "title: $(POST_TITLE)" specified.

  $(POST_SECTION_NUM) is a 3 digits number. It stands for the section that the
  post belongs to. All posts under the same section will be grouped together
  with the section title.

  $(POST_SECTION_TITLE) is the section title will be dispalyed.

  For instance,
  ---
  title: today is a good day to die
  section: 0000
  section_title: Generic
  ---

- The content of a post is in Markdown format.

- Put resources such as image under each post path

  For instance,
  2015-04-01-000000-today.is.a.good.day.to.die.md

  after Jekyll generated it to html page, the directory structure looks like

_site/documents/users/
      |-- 2015
          `-- 04
              `-- 01
                  `-- 000000-today.is.a.good.day.to.die
                      `-- index.html

  if one wants to upload and display img.png in this post, then just create
path before generate, and put image inside.

documents/users/
|-- 2015
    `-- 04
        `-- 01
            `-- 000000-today.is.a.good.day.to.die
                `-- img.png
