How to add a post
-----------------

The original directory layout looks like the following:

blog/
|-- page*
`-- _posts

- Blog posts should be .md files under _posts.

- Naming of each post should be
  yyyy-mm-dd-$(POST_NAME).md

  $(POST_NAME) could be any string, for each word in the string, use dot to
  separate. It is the default post name that will be displayed. One can also use
  a different post name from the file name by specifying the YAML front matter
  inside the .md file.

  For instance,
  2015-12-24-introduction.to.blog.md

- YAML front matter in each post
  ---
  title: $(POST_TITLE)
  ---

  $(POST_TITLE) is the post title will be displayed. It overrides the
  $(POST_NAME) in file name if "title: $(POST_TITLE)" specified.

  For instance,
  ---
  title: Introduction to bithollow blog
  ---

- The content of a post is in Markdown format.

- Put resources such as image under each post path

  For instance,
  2015-12-24-introduction.to.blog.md

  after Jekyll generated it to html page, the directory structure looks like

_site/blog/
|-- 2015
|   `-- 12
|       `-- 24
|           `-- introduction.to.blog
|               `-- index.html
`-- page*
    `-- index.html

  if one wants to upload and display img.png in this post, then just create
path before generate, and put image inside.

blog/
|-- 2015
    `-- 12
        `-- 24
            `-- introduction.to.blog
                `-- start.jpg

  when add image to .md file, existing style classes could be applied.
  ![img](/path/to/img.png){: $(STYLE_CLASS) ...}

  $(STYLE_CLASS) could be:
  * .center-image
  * .small-image
  * .medium-image
  * .large-image
  * .img-thumbnail
  * .img-cricle
  * .img-rounded

  For instance,
  ![start](/blog/2015/12/24/introduction.to.blog/start.jpg){: .center-image .img-thumbnail}

- Generate blog pages

  The blog page generation depends on extra Jekyll plugin which can't be executed in github. So blog pages are generated locally, then push to remote.

  Example steps of generating blog pages:

  1. clone git repo and sub modules
  $ git clone https://github.com/bithollow/bithollow.github.io.git
  $ cd bithollow.github.io
  $ git submodule init _plugins
  $ git submodule update _plugins

  2. modify blog .md file and generate blog pages
  $ emacs -nw blog/_posts/xxx.md
  $ make blog

  If no error occured after 'make', check the changed file(s) under blog directory in with 'git status', commit and push them to remote.
