#### **Install APM**

   * You can run APM (ArduPilot) on Raspberry Pi with BH. The autopilot's code works directly on Raspberry Pi using the APM's Linux HAL.
     Even though it is possible to run APM on standard Raspbian distribution it won't work properly as it requires lower latency.
     Please use Raspbian with real time kernel for running APM, you can get it in prepare SD image section.

   * Here are install steps(APM binary download [here](https://github.com/bithollow/tools/tree/master/pkg)):

    a. Download the APM binary.
    b. Store it to RPI /home/bit/ardupilot/ArduCopter/ArduCopter.elf via USB or scp.
    c. Run APM binary refer to next page.

   * If you'd like to build the binary yourself please proceed to the Building from sources.
