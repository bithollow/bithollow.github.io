#### **Running APM**

##### **Running APM**
   * Run APM binary the following in your RPi's console

    cd /home/bit/ardupilot/ArduCopter/
    sudo ArduCopter.elf -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550

   * Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the device with the Ground Control Station - your laptop, smartphone etc.
     Arguments specify serial ports (TCP or UDP can be used instead of serial ports) :

    -A is for primary telemetry
    -B is for external GPS
    -C is for secondary telemetry (it can be used without primary telemetry)
    -E is for secondary external GPS

   * When using UART for telemetry please note that default baud rates are: 115200 for primary (-A)
     57600 for secondary (-C) 3DR Radios are configured for 57600 by default,
     so the simplest way to connect over them is to run with -C option.
     If you would like to transfer telemetry over the UART port on BH you can specify it like this:

    sudo ArduCopter.elf -C /dev/ttyAMA0

   * UDP and serial telemetry can be used simultaneously like this:

    sudo ArduCopter.elf –A 192.168.1.2:14550 –C /dev/ttyAMA0


##### **Autostarting APM on boot**
   ardupilot is configed into a system service by default. Once you power on your raspberry board, ardupilot will launch automaticlly. Please take a look into the service config file in /lib/systemd/system/ardupilot.sercice. If you'd like to stop or disable ardupilot auto start. ssh to your raspberry board and execute "sudo systemctl stop ardupilot" or "sudo systemctl disable ardupilot". Regarding how to access to raspberry board, please check "Configuring WiFi access" and "Configuring Ethernet access" sections in [Software Configuration] => [Prepare SD Image]

##### **Connecting to the GCS**
   * [APM Planner](http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?category=35) is a ground station software for APM.
   It can be downloaded from the ardupilot.com APM Planner listens on UDP port 14550,
   so it should catch telemetry from the drone automatically.

   * [Mission planner](http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-install-mission-planner/) is another GCS for APM, you can try it.

##### **Build from Source code**

    [TODO]
    a. Prepare the build environment
    b. Get the code
       there is APM source code which stored /home/bit/ardupilot by default.
       if user want to
    c. Building APM

##### **Further configuration**

   * As other APM configuration procedures are very similar for most APM-running autopilot hardware, please use the APM documentation.
