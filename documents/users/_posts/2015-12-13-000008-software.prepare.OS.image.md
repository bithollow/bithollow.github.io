#### **Prepare SD Card System OS Image**
   * We provide a SD card image of Raspbian with fully preemptive real-time Linux kernel.
   The image is also additionally configured for usage in drone applications.
   If you’d like to only use APM autopilot , please refer to [here](https://github.com/bithollow/bitburger/tree/master/sdimages/rpi2) for simple SD image.
   Otherwise, if you `d like to do some development, please refer to [here](https://github.com/bithollow/bitburger/tree/master/sdimages/rpi2) for imag, which has pre-installed APM source code and some tools.

##### **<1> Write image to SD card**

###### **On Windows:**

   * Extract an image (using 7-Zip or other unpacker).
   * Download and extract [Win32DiskImager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) utility
   * Run Win32DiskImager utility with administrator rights.
   * Select the extracted image file and sd card drive letter.
   * Click “Write”. The process may take a few minutes.

###### **On Linux:**
   * Extract an image. Unmount SD card partitions if they were mounted. Run following command(Ubuntu):

    sudo dd bs=1M if=emlid-raspberrypi2-raspbian-rt-20150401.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

   * More detailed instructions are available [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).
