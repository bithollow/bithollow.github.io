##### **Overview**

   * It is best to power your BH with a power module to reduce the chances of a brownout. 
 
   * This page explains how to set up Power module to measure battery voltage and current consumption.

   * BH has two power sources, all of them can be used simultaneously as they are protected by ideal diodes.
     
     <1> Connect 5V 1A power adapter to the Raspberry Pi’s microUSB port. Raspberry Pi will provide power to the BH.
 
     <2> Use BECs that provide voltage in a range of 4.8-5.3V.

##### **Power Module Configuration in Mission Planner**
   
   * A power module can be used to provide a stable power supply to the system, and to accurately measure the battery voltage/current in order to trigger a return to launch on low battery. The bellow explains how to set up and configure power modules using Mission Planner.

   * Mission Planner Setup

        Battery measurement is primarily set up in the Mission Planner‘s INITIAL SETUP | Optional Hardware | Battery Monitor screen.

   * Enable Low Battery Alert

        You can set Mission Planner to alert you verbally when your battery is low (using a computerized voice).

        Simply check the MP Alert on Low Battery checkbox and enter the warning you wish to hear, the voltage level and finally t
he percentage of remaining current.
