How to add a post
-----------------

The original directory layout looks like the following:

blog/
|-- page*
`-- _posts

- Blog posts should be .md files under _posts.

- Naming of each post should be
  yyyy-mm-dd-$(POST_NAME).md

  $(POST_NAME) could be any string, for each word in the string, use dot to
  separate. It is the default post name that will be displayed. One can also use
  a different post name from the file name by specifying the YAML front matter
  inside the .md file.

  For instance,
  2015-12-24-introduction.to.blog.md

- YAML front matter in each post
  ---
  title: $(POST_TITLE)
  ---

  $(POST_TITLE) is the post title will be displayed. It overrides the
  $(POST_NAME) in file name if "title: $(POST_TITLE)" specified.

  For instance,
  ---
  title: Introduction to bithollow blog
  ---

- The content of a post is in Markdown format.

- Put resources such as image under each post path

  For instance,
  2015-12-24-introduction.to.blog.md

  after Jekyll generated it to html page, the directory structure looks like

_site/blog/
|-- 2015
|   `-- 12
|       `-- 24
|           `-- introduction.to.blog
|               `-- index.html
`-- page*
    `-- index.html

  if one wants to upload and display img.png in this post, then just create
path before generate, and put image inside.

blog/
|-- 2015
    `-- 12
        `-- 24
            `-- introduction.to.blog
                `-- start.jpg

  when add image to .md file, existing style classes could be applied.
  ![img](/path/to/img.png){: $(STYLE_CLASS) ...}

  $(STYLE_CLASS) could be:
  * .center-image
  * .small-image
  * .medium-image
  * .large-image
  * .img-thumbnail
  * .img-cricle
  * .img-rounded

  For instance,
  ![start](/blog/2015/12/24/introduction.to.blog/start.jpg){: .center-image .img-thumbnail}
