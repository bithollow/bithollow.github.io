#### **GPS**

   * MPU9250 is one of the best in class inertial sensors, which combines a gyroscope,
   an accelerometer and a magnetometer in one device. MPU sensor family is not only popular as a part of drone autopilot projects,
   but is also widely used in devices like cellphones, tablets, etc.

##### **Driver**

   * If you haven't already done that, download BH drivers and demo code like this:

    git clone https://github.com/bithollow/BH
    cd BH/driver

   * Move to folder BH/driver/, you will find the gps driver: ublox.cpp ublox.h

##### **Demo**

   * imu example

   Move to folder BH/demo/gps, compile and run the example

    cd BH/demo/gps
    make
    ./gps -h

    Hhe usage will show, you can refer to it,.
    You should immediately see 9 values, updated in real time.
    Try to move the device around and see them change.
    They include Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer data, three axis each.
    The main function loop is pretty straightforward: read the data, print the data.
