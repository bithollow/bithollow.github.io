#### **9 Axes IMU**

   * MPU9250 is one of the best in class inertial sensors, which combines a gyroscope,
   an accelerometer and a magnetometer in one device. MPU sensor family is not only popular as a part of drone autopilot projects,
   but is also widely used in devices like cellphones, tablets, etc.

##### **Driver**

   * If you haven't already done that, download BH drivers and demo code like this:

    git clone https://github.com/bithollow/BH
    cd BH/driver

   * Move to folder BH/driver/, you will find the mpu9250 driver: mpu9250.h mpu9250.cpp

##### **Demo**

   * imu example

Move to folder BH/demo/imu, compile and run the example

    cd BH/demos/imu
    make
    ./imu -h

   You should immediately see 9 values, updated in real time.
Try to move the device around and see them change.
They include Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer data, three axis each.
The main function loop is pretty straightforward: read the data, print the data.

You can find additional information about MPU9250 in the datasheet.

   Another examples for BH emonstrates the work of Mahony AHRS with the data from an onboard MPU9250 sensor.
We’ve also made a simple but cool visualizer for it that you can run on your PC\Mac.
Here’s the instruction how to run AHRS and visualizer:

    git clone https://github.com/bithollow/BH
    cd BH/demo/ahrs
    ./ahrs -h
