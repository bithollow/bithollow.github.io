    12-bit resolution
    Configurable frequency
    I2C operation up to 1MHz
    Output enable pin
   * PCA9685 is clocked by the 24.576MHz TCXO oscillator and allows to adjust frequency using the PRE_SCALE register. Rising and falling edges for each channel can be set from 0 to 4095 allowing to control duty cycle as well as phase. etc.


##### **Driver**

   * If you haven't already done that, download BH drivers and demo code like this:

    git clone https://github.com/bithollow/BH
    cd BH/driver/

   * Move to folder BH/driver/, you will find the gps driver: pca9685.h pca9685.cpp

##### **Demo**

   * rgbled example

   Move to folder BH/demo/rgbled, compile and run the example

    cd BH/demo/rgbled
    make
    ./rgbled -h

   the usage will show. you can try it according to the usage.
